#' Weights of Covariates
#'
#' This function takes the regression object and calculates the relative
#' importance of different covariates.
#' The relative importance is only valid when the covariates are standardized.
#'
#' @param Model A "lm" or "glm" object.
#' @param Rounding Desired rounding, default is up to 2 decimal places (i.e. 0.01\%).
#' @param Exact If Exact = TRUE, the function will return weights with the sum of exactly
#' 100. Default is set to FALSE, to reduce time required for computation.
#' @param Intercept Does the regression object have an intercept term? Default is set to
#' TRUE.
#' @export
#' @examples CovariateWeights(RegressionModel, Rounding = 1, Exact = TRUE)
